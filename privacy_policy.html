                    <p>b. For research and development: </p>
                    <p>We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, secure, integrated and useful to
                        you. We use
                        collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided to us to
                        troubleshoot and to
                        identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the
                        Services; to analyze
                        and improve our Site and/or Services (including developing new products and services); improving
                        safety;
                        managing our communications; analyzing our products; performing market research; for
                        peer-reviewed and
                        non-peer-reviewed clinical research; and performing data analytics. </p>
                    <p>c. Account Opening Related Data: </p>
                    <p>In order to maintain integrity of the Service, Codebell must take measures to avoid creation of
                        accounts by
                        spammers. Each User Account is unique and associated with an individual. Therefore, a unique
                        identifier is
                        generated and associated with each user. Contact number is used to facilitate messaging service
                        between one or
                        more users of the service. The legal basis for processing is User Consent. You are free to
                        delete your User
                        Account and remove that data in the account panel of your Codebell User account. </p>
                    <p>d. Verification: </p>
                    <p>Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about Codebell, to send
                        you information
                        related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your User Account, to verify your
                        User Account, or
                        to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may also inform you about new
                        Codebell features
                        in which you might have an interest. You are free, at any given time, to opt-out of those
                        features through the
                        account settings panel. In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of
                        accounts by
                        spam bots or human spammers, Codebell uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be
                        asked to verify
                        using either reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided
                        are saved
                        temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer. </p>
                    <p>e. Unauthorized Login: </p>
                    <p>In order to detect unusual activity from your User Account, geolocation and IP addresses are used
                        to ascertain
                        only genuine users are using the services, and any suspicious activity is reported to the user.
                        The legal basis
                        for processing is our legitimate interest to prevent unauthorized use of Service and protection
                        of user’s
                        interest, thereby maintaining integrity of the Service. Any personal information, so collected,
                        is stored in
                        encrypted form on Codebell’s servers.</p>
                    <p>f. Communicating with Codebell: </p>
                    <p>Your communications with the Company, such as support requests, bug reports, or feature requests
                        may be saved by
                        our staff. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more
                        efficiently and
                        improve the quality of the Codebell service.</p>
                    <p>g. Payment Information: </p>
                    <p>The Company relies on third parties to process credit card, PayPal, and other payment gateways
                        and hence the
                        Company necessarily must share payment information with third parties. The legal basis of this
                        processing is the
                        necessity to the execution of the contract between you and us.</p>
                    <p>h. With your consent: </p>
                    <p>We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not
                        listed above.
                        For example, we may publish testimonials or featured client stories to promote the Services, BUT
                        ONLY with your
                        permission.</p>
                    <p>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights: </p>
                    <p>Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests
                        and the
                        interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance,
                        accounting,
                        regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or
                        sale of a
                        business.</p>
                    <p>Please do note that Codebell will take reasonable precautions to protect your information from
                        loss, misuse or
                        alteration. Please be aware, however, that any text, email or other transmission you send
                        unencrypted through
                        the Internet cannot be completely protected against unauthorized interception. </p>
                    <p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the
                        right to change
                        your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.</p>
