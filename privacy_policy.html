                <p>We are always looking for ways to make our Services smarter, secure, integrated and useful to
                    you. We use
                    collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided to us to
                    troubleshoot and to
                    identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of the
                    Services; to analyze
                    and improve our Site and/or Services (including developing new products and services); improving

                <p>Account Opening Related Data: </p>
                <p>In order to maintain integrity of the Service, Codebell must take measures to avoid creation of
                    accounts by
                    spammers. Each User Account is unique and associated with an individual. Therefore, a unique
                    identifier is
                    generated and associated with each user. Contact number is used to facilitate messaging service
                    between one or
                    more users of the service. The legal basis for processing is User Consent. You are free to
                    delete your User
                    Account and remove that data in the account panel of your Codebell User account. </p>

                <p>Verification: </p>
                <p>Such data will only be used to contact you with important notifications about Codebell, to send
                    you information
                    related to security, to send you an invitation link to create your User Account, to verify your
                    User Account, or
                    to send you password recovery links if you enable the option. We may also inform you about new
                    Codebell features
                    in which you might have an interest. You are free, at any given time, to opt-out of those
                    features through the
                    account settings panel. In order to pursue our legitimate interest of preventing the creation of
                    accounts by
                    spam bots or human spammers, Codebell uses a variety of human verification methods. You may be
                    asked to verify
                    using either reCaptcha, Email, or SMS. IP addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers provided
                    are saved
                    temporarily in order to send you a verification code and to determine if you are a spammer. </p>

                <p>Unauthorized Login: </p>
                <p>In order to detect unusual activity from your User Account, geolocation and IP addresses are used
                    to ascertain
                    only genuine users are using the services, and any suspicious activity is reported to the user.
                    The legal basis
                    for processing is our legitimate interest to prevent unauthorized use of Service and protection
                    of user’s
                    interest, thereby maintaining integrity of the Service. Any personal information, so collected,

                    may be saved by
                    our staff. The legal basis for processing is our legitimate interest to troubleshoot more

            <li>
                <p>Payment Information: </p>
                <p>The Company relies on third parties to process credit card, PayPal, and other payment gateways
                    and hence the
                    Company necessarily must share payment information with third parties. The legal basis of this
                    processing is the
                    necessity to the execution of the contract between you and us.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>With your consent: </p>
                <p>We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not
                    listed above.
                    For example, we may publish testimonials or featured client stories to promote the Services, BUT

                <p>Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests
                    and the
                    interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance,
                    accounting,
                    regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or
                    sale of a
                    business.</p>
                <p>Please do note that Codebell will take reasonable precautions to protect your information from
                    loss, misuse or
                    alteration. Please be aware, however, that any text, email or other transmission you send
                    unencrypted through
                    the Internet cannot be completely protected against unauthorized interception. </p>
                <p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the
                    right to change
