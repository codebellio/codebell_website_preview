                            on
                            the Site. Payment for a subscription is due upfront, is non-refundable and can be made by
                            any of the
                            payment methods available on the Site. Failure to make regular payments on Codebell accounts
                            may
                            result
                            in suspension of User Account.
                        <li> The subscription gives you access to a Codebell Account for a period of a year unless
                            specified
                            otherwise (“Subscription Period”). At the end of this Subscription Period, your subscription
                            will
                            automatically renew (for an equivalent period (and continue to do so), unless you have

                            cancelled
                            your subscription.
                        <li> If your subscription to a Service renews, charges for each renewal period (at the same
                            level as
                            the
                            preceding subscription period, unless the charges have increased, in which case we will
                            notify you
                            at
                            least 14 days beforehand) will automatically be charged to your account, in advance, on the

                            date
                            (or shortly before or after), unless you have already cancelled your subscription.
                        <li> If you do not wish your subscription to a Service to renew automatically at the end of the
                            then-current subscription period you must notify us (see “Contacting us”), or alter the
                            subscription
                            renewal settings of your account through the Site, at least 7 days in advance of renewal. If
                            you do
                            not
                            do this or not in sufficient time, you will have authorized us to charge the applicable fees
                            described
                            above and you agree to pay such fees. It is your responsibility to notify us in advance of

                        <li>Missed payments - If we are unable to collect payment - for example because of rejected card
                            transactions or unpaid invoices - the account in question will be made unavailable
                            (“Frozen”) until
                            the
                            required payment is received.
                        <li> Free Trial: From time to time, we may offer products or features available at no charge for

                            period, at our sole discretion, including as to duration and scope of no charge offers.
                            However, we
                            reserve the right to charge you for such products (at the normal rate) in the event that we
                            determine
                            (in our reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you
                            are
                            using
                            any service, proxy or other device or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating
                            you.
                        <li> For paid Services that offer a free trial, we explain the length of trial when you sign up.
                            After
                            the
                            trial period, you need to pay in advance to keep using the Service. If you do not pay, we
                            will
                            freeze
                            your account and it will be inaccessible until you make payment. If your account has been
                            frozen for
                            a
                            while, we will queue it up for auto-cancellation.
                            i) If you are upgrading from a Basic plan to a Premium plan, we will charge your card
                            immediately
                            and
                            your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan
                            level, the
                            new
                            rate starts from the next billing cycle.
                        <li>We make a promise to our customers to support our Services until the end of the Internet.
                            That
                            means
                            when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any
                            legacy
                            Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a
                            part of
                            our
                            Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product.
                            We
                            reserve
                            the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our

                            with or without notice.
                        <li>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to
                            exempt
                            existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for
                            existing
                            customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days' notice and will notify you via the
                            email
                            address
                            on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services
                            themselves.
                        <li>All fees are inclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where
                            required,
                            we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to
                            taxing
                            authorities. See our Taxes policy for more details. Otherwise, you are responsible for
                            payment of

                        <li>Using the Service on mobile applications will use some of the internet data to which you

                            for such
                            data usage. Out-of-country usage may in any event lead to significantly higher costs than
                            regular
                            usage,
                            and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming
                            and
                            other
                            applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.
                        <li>By signing up for the Codebell Account, you are expressly agreeing that the Company is
                            authorized
                            to
                            charge you subscription fee as per your selected plan, any other fees for additional
                            services you
                            may
                            purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Codebell Account
                            through the
                            credit card or other payment method accepted by the Company ("Payment Method") that you
                            provided
                            during
                            registration. If you want to use a different Payment Method than the one you signed up for
                            during
                            registration, or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you

                            you do
                            not
                            edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account, you authorize us to continue
                            billing,
                            and
                            you will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Once billing commences, we may
                            continue to
                            bill
                            your Payment Method for your subscription fee until you cancel the same and there are no
                            refunds or
                            credits once the subscription has been renewed.
                        <li>As used in these Terms, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable,
                            against

                            subscription and
                            on
                            each subsequent renewal (as per plan chosen by you) thereafter unless and until you cancel

                            Terms.
                            To see the commencement date for your next renewal period, go to the billing information

                        <li>In order to sustain the Codebell Account, it is important that you honor the payment

                            in connection with the Codebell Account. You will remain liable to the Company for all such
                            amounts
                            and
                            all costs incurred by the Company in connection with the collection of these amounts,
                            including,
